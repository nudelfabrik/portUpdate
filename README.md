# portUpdate

In the FreeBSD Ports, the [UPDATING](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/moved-and-updating-files.html) file
contains instructions for packages if an update requries specific steps to continue to work.

With this project, users can set alerts to a number of ports and get notified when one of them requires specific commands.
